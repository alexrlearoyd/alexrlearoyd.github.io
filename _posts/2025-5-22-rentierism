You have a friend, who works a nurse. She has a degree in nursing and a postgraduate diploma in advanced clinical practice. She is employed at St. Thomas’ Hospital, where she works night shifts, and is regularly exposed to trauma from patients.

She receives £42,000 in salary. She is then subject to pay £5,486 of that in income taxes. Another £2,354 is paid in National Insurance contributions. Being auto enrolled in the NHS’ pension scheme, she pays in an additional £3,234. It is then time to pay student loans for her costly degrees - taking out an additional £1,323. That amounts to £12,397 in contributions, or an effective rate of 29.5% on gross income.

Thankfully, your car parking space is worth around £300,000. You decide to rent it out for each day which adds up to around £29,000 a year. You pay £2,860 in income tax. That is the only tax you face, meaning you face an effective rate of 9.8% in tax.
